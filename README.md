# CVE Reports for DWS

## Responsible disclosure
This repository follows the [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) model and discloses the vulnerable details after a period of time.
During this period, I try to contact the author of the vulnerable plugins and help them to patch or mitigate the issue.
The disclosure period is 15 days If I don't get the response from the original author. After than period, I wll open all 
details about the vulnerability. When the connection is established the release date depends on the discussion. 

## Intoduction
This repository will present all verified or suspected vulnerable dynamic web service(DWS) including Wordpress Plugin, 
Joomla Extension, and some CMS published in Github. I say "verified" means that the vulnerability report got the CVE ID from 
[WPScan](https://wpscan.com/) but "suspected" is not equal to _Safe For Use_.
