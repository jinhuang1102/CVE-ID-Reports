# CVE Reports for DWS
This repository will present all verified or suspected vulnerable dynamic web service(DWS) including Wordpress Plugin, 
Joomla Extension, and some CMS provided in Github. I say "verified" means that the vulnerable report got the CVE ID from 
[WPScan](https://wpscan.com/) but "suspected" is not equal to _Safe For Use_.
