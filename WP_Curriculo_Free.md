# WP-Curricul Vitea Free <= 6.3 - Arbitrary File Upload
The plugin WP-Curriculo Vitae Free suffers the vulnerability to allow an arbitrary file uploaded from the remote attacker. 
It supports a registration form that allows the remote visitor to register their personal information on the plugin user's website.
The user with admin privilege could use the shortcode [formCadastro] in one page and the information about the register, including 
the profile picture and resume, will be stored in the local directory without any restriction in file extension.
