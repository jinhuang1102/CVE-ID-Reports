An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in N5 Upload Form before current version 1.0 allows the remote attackers to upload 
arbitrary executable files and achieve the remote code execution. The plugin provides a file uploading form to the plugin user 
and allows the user to decide which directory is used for the uploading files in the local operating system. 
But it does not ensure that the directory cannot be accessed by the remote attacker, and the extension of the file is also
unrestricted.
